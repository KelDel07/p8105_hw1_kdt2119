Load the tidyverse library.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## -- Attaching packages --------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.3.1 --

## Problem 1

The code chunk below produces a data frame that includes: a random
sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution, a logical vector
indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0, a
character vector of length 10, and a factor vector of length 10, with 3
different factor “levels”

``` r
problem1_df = tibble(
  vec_random = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = vec_random > 0,
  vec_charac = c("Kelvin", "is", "my", "name", "and", "data", "science", "is",
               "my", "game"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("down", "middle", "up", "up", "up", "middle", "down", "middle", "up", "down"))
)
```

#### To take the mean of each variable in problem1\_df

``` r
problem1_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 4
    ##    vec_random vec_logical vec_charac vec_factor
    ##         <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>      <fct>     
    ##  1      0.549 TRUE        Kelvin     down      
    ##  2     -0.218 FALSE       is         middle    
    ##  3     -1.15  FALSE       my         up        
    ##  4      0.147 TRUE        name       up        
    ##  5      0.294 TRUE        and        up        
    ##  6     -0.228 FALSE       data       middle    
    ##  7     -0.864 FALSE       science    down      
    ##  8      1.42  TRUE        is         middle    
    ##  9      0.123 TRUE        my         up        
    ## 10     -0.781 FALSE       game       down

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_random))
```

    ## [1] -0.07147857

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_charac))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem1_df, vec_charac)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Taking the mean of the numerical random sample vector (vec\_random) and
logical vector (vec\_logical) works. Taking the mean of the character
vector (vec\_charac) and factor vector (vec\_factor) does not work. For
the functions that did not work, a warning message stating “argument is
not numeric or logical: returning NA” was returned.

#### To convert the variables in problem1\_df to numeric

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_logical))
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_charac))
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor))
```

Converting the logical vector to a numeric vector with 0’s and 1’s
works, thus explaining our ability to obtain a mean for this. This
happens as the logical vector is outputting TRUE or FALSE, which may be
converted converted to 0’s and 1’s.

Converting the factor vector to a numeric vector with 1, 2, and 3
works.This is because the software recognizes the factor vector has
three levels and assigns each level a number.This reason does not
account for a mean not being produced for the factor vector which
perhaps may be due to a mean value perhaps not being a good statistic to
describe all three levels.

Converting the character vector to a numeric vector does not work. It
also returns an NA value.This is as there is no underlying numeric
integer to represent the character vector. This accounts for a mean not
being generated for the character vector, as the character vector can
not be converted to a numeric format from which a mean may be
calculated.

## Question 2

The following code loads the penguins dataset, includes a description of
the penguins dataset, and provides a scatterplot of the data.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
flipper_mean = mean(pull(penguins,flipper_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE)
```

#### Description of the Penguins Dataset

Below we describe the dataset including names, the size of the dataset,
and the mean flipper length.

The data in this dataset includes species, island, bill\_length\_mm,
bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm, body\_mass\_g, sex, year. The size
of dataset we have is 2752. The mean flipper length is 200.9152047.

#### Scatterplot of the Penguins Dataset

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```
