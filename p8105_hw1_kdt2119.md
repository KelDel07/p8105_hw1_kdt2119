Load the tidyverse library.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## -- Attaching packages --------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.3.1 --

    ## v ggplot2 3.3.5     v purrr   0.3.4

    ## v tidyr   1.1.3     v stringr 1.4.0
    ## v readr   2.0.1     v forcats 0.5.1

## Problem 1

The code chunk below produces a data frame that includes: a random
sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution, a logical vector
indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0, a
character vector of length 10, and a factor vector of length 10, with 3
different factor “levels”

``` r
problem1_df = tibble(
  vec_random = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = vec_random > 0,
  vec_charac = c("Kelvin", "is", "my", "name", "and", "data", "science", "is",
               "my", "game"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("down", "middle", "up", "up", "up", "middle", "down", "middle", "up", "down"))
)
```

#### To take the mean of each variable in problem1\_df

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_random))
```

    ## [1] -0.1236998

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_charac))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem1_df, vec_charac)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Taking the mean of the numerical random sample vector (vec\_random) and
logical vector (vec\_logical) works. Taking the mean of the character
vector (vec\_charac) and factor vector (vec\_factor) does not work. For
the functions that did not work, a warning message stating “argument is
not numeric or logical: returning NA” was returned.

#### To convert the variables in problem1\_df to numeric

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_logical))
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_charac))
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor))
```

Converting the logical vector to a numeric vector with 0’s and 1’s
works, thus explaining our ability to obtain a mean for this. This
happens as the logical vector is outputting TRUE or FALSE, which may be
converted converted to 0’s and 1’s.

Converting the factor vector to a numeric vector with 1, 2, and 3
works.This is because the software recognizes the factor vector has
three levels and assigns each level a number.This reason does not
account for a mean not being produced for the factor vector which
perhaps may be due to a mean value perhaps not being a good statistic to
describe all three levels.

Converting the character vector to a numeric vector does not work. It
also returns an NA value.This is as there is no underlying numeric
integer to represent the character vector. This accounts for a mean not
being generated for the character vector, as the character vector can
not be converted to a numeric format from which a mean may be
calculated.

## Question 2

The following code loads the penguins dataset and includes a description
of the penguins dataset, as well as a scatterplot of the data.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

#### Description of the Penguins Dataset

Below we describe the dataset including names / values of important
variables, the size of the dataset, and the mean flipper length.

The names of the variables in the penguins data set include species,
island, bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm,
body\_mass\_g, sex, year. Of these variables, some important variables
to to understand the characteristics of the penguins include the various
species, sex, bill\_length\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm. There are 3 species
of penguins that include Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo. There are 165 female
and 168 male penguins in the data. The range of values for the penguin
bill length is (32.1, 59.6 mm).

The size of the data set penguins is 344 rows and 8 columns.

The mean flipper length is 200.92 mm.

#### Scatterplot of the Penguins Dataset

Below is a scatterplot with bill length on the x-axis and flipper length
on the y-axis. The 3 species of penguins can be seen in the legend and
are colored in the plot. The code chunk here creates the scatter plot
and saves the image.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)
       ) + geom_point()
```
